# Aurora Storefront

Welcome to Aurora Storefront â€“ a minimal Nuxt-based product storefront project. This project allows users to browse a menu of products and manage their shopping cart, while admins can easily add, update, and delete products. With integrated image management through Cloudinary, every product's image is handled securely from upload to deletion.

## Production
Build the Project
To generate a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Firebase Configuration
This project is designed to make it easy to have multiple free deployments on a free platform like Vercel. Each store deployment requires its own Firebase project configuration. Set up your Firebase project and add the configuration values to your environment variables:

1. Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase Console
2. Enable Realtime Database
3. Get your project configuration from Project Settings
4. Add all Firebase configuration values to your environment variables

The project uses environment variables for complete Firebase configuration, making it secure and flexible for multiple deployments.


## Preview the Production Build
To preview your production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Cloudinary Integration
This project integrates with Cloudinary to handle product images. The key points are:

Uploading: When a new product is added or its image is updated, the image is uploaded to Cloudinary using an unsigned upload preset.
Updating: Before updating a product's image, the existing image (if any) is deleted using a secure API call.
Deleting: When deleting a product, its associated image is removed from Cloudinary using a custom API endpoint (/api/deleteImage) that generates a secure signature.
Consult the Nuxt Cloudinary documentation for further details.

## Analytics Configuration
Each store deployment can track its analytics independently:

1. Create a Google Analytics 4 property
2. Get your Measurement ID (starts with G-)
3. Add it to your environment variables as GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID

The analytics will automatically track page views and events for your specific store deployment, giving you isolated data for each store instance.

## Themes
The project supports multiple themes (default, fashion, electronics, luxury, dark, nature). Adjust the global theme in app.vue using the useTheme composable:

## Themes
The project supports multiple themes (default, fashion, electronics, luxury, dark, nature). Each store deployment can have its own theme set through environment variables:

```bash
STORE_THEME=default  # Options: default, fashion, electronics, luxury, dark, nature
```

Themes are defined in assets/css/themes.css and control key color variables throughout the app. Free free to  customize and extend the themes as needed.

## Admin Panel
Access the admin panel at /admin:

Admin Login: You can log in using the credentials specified in the .env file.
CRUD Operations: Admins can add, update, and delete products. When products are deleted or updated (with a new image), the corresponding images are handled on Cloudinary automatically.
Security: A middleware (middleware/admin.js) and the AdminLogin.vue component are used to control access.


Happy coding and enjoy building with Aurora Storefront!
